# odin-landing-page

I created a landing page from scratch using a given landing page as a reference. I used my newly acquired FlexBot skills as well as some beginner CSS and HTML to create this. 

Here are some things I found challenging:
- Overusing Flexbot. I found that I was using Flexbot as my first choice when trying to style certain elements instead of making use of normal flow, and properties such as text-align. To fix this I always first tried to style an element to what I wanted without the use of Flexbot, and then used Flexbot when needed, not as first choice.
- Coming up with concise class names and not using more classes then needed. I found that I was adding classes to everything and making my index.html more cluttered when I could just make use of descendant combinators.
- Trying to make my commit messages perfect and ensuring I follow the same style for every commit message.
- Figuring out the perfect amount of pixels for margins and paddings. I can be a perfectionist so I took some time on this to get it as right as I can.
